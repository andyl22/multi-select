# Multi-Select With Search Input And Selection Display

Simple multi-select that allows for the user to input text in a search field to narrow down picklist options, and allows for the user to select/deselect any options.

For GH-pages, since the express API used to feed data is not available, there is some placeholder data in place of the fetchData function in MultiSelectContainer.js

Styled with scss.


The GH Pages deploy is located @ https://andyl22.github.io/multi-select/
